1. Male to female jumper wires (x8)

## Overview of Usage

1. Download and install STM32CubeIDE version 1.5.0.
1. Download and import this project into your STM32CubeIDE.
1. Connect your Arducam to the board with jumper wires.
1. Compile and flash program into your STM32F746G-DISCO discovery board.

## Detailed Instruction

0. Prepare an STM32F746G-DISCO discovery board and an Arducam.
1. Download STM32CubeIDE, an C/C++ development platform with peripheral configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debug features for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors.

- Please download STM32CubeIDE **version 1.5.0**. \[[Link](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html#get-software)\]
- Please refer to “UM2563 STM32CubeIDE installation guide” and “UM2553 STM32CubeIDE quick start guide” for more detailed installation and user guides. \[[Link](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html#documentation)\]

2. Prepare the codebase.

- First, please follow the instruction in [`Setup for Users`](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/tinyengine#setup-for-users) to setup your environment.
- Copy the `tutorial/inference` folder and rename it as `TinyEngine_vww_tutorial` (for use in STM32CubeIDE later).

```bash
cp -r ./tutorial/inference ./tutorial/TinyEngine_vww_tutorial
```

- Setup PYTHONPATH, and run the codegen example of VWW:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)
python examples/vww.py  # To apply patch-based inference, please use `example/vww_patchbased.py`
```

- Move the new generated `codegen` folder to the following path:

```bash
mkdir ./tutorial/TinyEngine_vww_tutorial/Src/TinyEngine
mv codegen ./tutorial/TinyEngine_vww_tutorial/Src/TinyEngine
```

- Copy and paste the `TinyEngine` folder to the following path:

```bash
cp -r ./TinyEngine/include ./tutorial/TinyEngine_vww_tutorial/Src/TinyEngine
cp -r ./TinyEngine/src ./tutorial/TinyEngine_vww_tutorial/Src/TinyEngine
```

- Copy and paste the required Arm files to the correct path by using the following shell script:

```bash
bash import_arm_inference.sh
```

3. Setup STM32CubeIDE for compilation and run.

- Import the `TinyEngine_vww_tutorial` codebase into your STM32CubeIDE by: \[File\] -> \[Import…\] -> \[General\] -> \[Existing Projects into Workspace\] (Import the entire `TinyEngine_vww_tutorial` folder).

<img src="../../assets/figures/0_import_project_0.png" alt="0_import_project_0" width="47%"/>  <img src="../../assets/figures/1_import_project_1.png" alt="1_import_project_1" width="46%"/>

- After the import, `TinyEngine_vww_tutorial` should be shown in Project Explorer of your STM32CubeIDE as the example figure below:

<img src="../../assets/figures/2_project_explorer.png" alt="2_project_explorer" width="30%"/>

- Open `TinyEngine_vww_tutorial/Src/main.cpp`, as shown in the figure below:

<img src="../../assets/figures/3_main_cpp.png" alt="3_main_cpp" width="80%"/>

- Verify you have the correct compilation settings. (The default settings should be correct, but please follow the following steps to make sure that.):

  - Set the include paths of GCC compiler by \[Project\] -> \[Properties\] -> \[C/C++ Build\] -> \[Settings\] -> \[Tool Settings\] -> \[MCU GCC Compiler\] -> \[Include paths\] as the figure below:

  <img src="../../assets/figures/4_gcc_include_paths.png" alt="4_gcc_include_paths" width="65%"/>

  - Set the optimization level of GCC compiler to `-Ofast` by \[Project\] -> \[Properties\] -> \[C/C++ Build\] -> \[Settings\] -> \[Tool Settings\] -> \[MCU GCC Compiler\] -> \[Optimization\] as the figure below:

  <img src="../../assets/figures/5_gcc_optimization.png" alt="5_gcc_optimization" width="65%"/>

  - Set the include paths of G++ compiler by \[Project\] -> \[Properties\] -> \[C/C++ Build\] -> \[Settings\] -> \[Tool Settings\] -> \[MCU G++ Compiler\] -> \[Include paths\] as the figure below:

  <img src="../../assets/figures/6_gplusplus_include_paths.png" alt="6_gplusplus_include_paths" width="65%"/>

  - Set the optimization level of G++ compiler to `-Ofast` by \[Project\] -> \[Properties\] -> \[C/C++ Build\] -> \[Settings\] -> \[Tool Settings\] -> \[MCU G++ Compiler\] -> \[Optimization\] as the figure below:

  <img src="../../assets/figures/7_gplusplus_optimization.png" alt="7_gplusplus_optimization" width="65%"/>

- Click \[Project\] -> \[Build Project\] to build/compile the program and generate the binary executable files.

- Set the run/debug configurations by \[Run\] -> \[Run Configurations…\] -> \[STM32 Cortex-M C/C++  Application\] -> \[TinyEngine_vww_tutorial Debug\] -> \[C/C++ Application\] -> \[Browse…\]:

  - Point to the correct elf file (file path: `Debug/TinyEngine_vww_tutorial.elf`) to correctly run the program, as shown in the figure below:

<img src="../../assets/figures/8_run_configurations_0.png" alt="8_run_configurations_0" width="49%"/>  <img src="../../assets/figures/9_run_configurations_1.png" alt="9_run_configurations_1" width="49%"/>

4. Setup your STM32F746G-DISCO discovery board to connect the Arducam to the board and also establish the USB connection with the board.

- Connect your Arducam to the board with jumper wires according to the following PIN connection:

  - SPI: MOSI->PB15(D11), MISO->PB14(D12), SCK->PI_1(D13), CS(NSS)->PI_0(D5), VCC-> 3.3V, GND->GND
  - I2C: SCL->PB8(D15). SDA->PB9(D14)

  <img src="../../assets/figures/11_mcu_side_view.png" alt="11_mcu_side_view" width="40%"/>

  ```
                  (Top view)                                       (Side view)
  ```

- Establish the USB connection with the STM32F746G-DISCO discovery board.

5. Now, let’s run the demo.

- Click \[Run\] -> \[Run\] to execute the binary executable file on your board.
- If the system requires updating the ST-LINK firmware, please first click “OK”:

<img src="../../assets/figures/12_stlink_0.png" alt="12_stlink_0" width="40%"/>

- Click “Open in update mode”:

<img src="../../assets/figures/13_stlink_1.png" alt="13_stlink_1" width="40%"/>

- Click “Upgrade”:

<img src="../../assets/figures/14_stlink_2.png" alt="14_stlink_2" width="40%"/>

- Click \[Run\] -> \[Run\] in the STM32CubeIDE again.

6. If you successfully run the demo, the LCD screen on your STM32F746G-DISCO discovery board should display person detection results (person/no person) and frames per second (FPS), as shown in the example figure below:

   <img src="../../assets/figures/15_demo_person.png" alt="15_demo_person" width="40%"/>
    <img src="../../assets/figures/16_demo_no_person.png" alt="16_demo_no_person" width="40%"/>

   ```
                    (Person)                                       (No Person)
   ```

## Limitation

- Only tested the demo on STM32CubeIDE version 1.5.0.
