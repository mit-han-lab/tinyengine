   *
   * Introduction
   * ------------
   *
   * This user manual describes the CMSIS NN software library,
   * a collection of efficient neural network kernels developed to maximize the
   * performance and minimize the memory footprint of neural networks on Cortex-M processor cores.
   *
   * The library is divided into a number of functions each covering a specific category:
   * - Convolution Functions
   * - Activation Functions
   * - Fully-connected Layer Functions
   * - SVDF Layer Functions
   * - Pooling Functions
   * - Softmax Functions
   * - Basic math Functions
   *
   * The library has separate functions for operating on different weight and activation data
   * types including 8-bit integers (q7_t) and 16-bit integers (q15_t). The descrition of the
   * kernels are included in the function description. The implementation details are also
   * described in this paper [1].
   *
   * Function Classification
   * --------
   * The functions can be classified into two segments
   * - Legacy functions supporting ARM's internal symmetric quantization(8 bits).
   * - Functions that support TensorFlow Lite framework with symmetric quantization(8 bits).
   *
   * The legacy functions can be identified with their suffix of _q7 or _q15 and are no new development is done there.
   * The article in [2] describes in detail how to run a network using the legacy functions.
   *
   * The functions supporting TensorFlow Lite framework is identified by the _s8 suffix and can be invoked from TFL
   * micro. The functions are bit exact to TensorFlow Lite. Refer to the TensorFlow's documentation in [3] on how to run
   * a TensorFlow Lite model using optimized CMSIS-NN kernels.
   *
   * Block Diagram
   * --------

   *
   * Examples
   * --------
   *
   * The library ships with a number of examples which demonstrate how to use the library functions.
   *
   * Pre-processor Macros
   * ------------
   *
   * Each library project have different pre-processor macros.
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_DSP:
   *
   * Define macro ARM_MATH_DSP, If the silicon supports DSP instructions(DSP extension).
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_MVEI:
   *
   * Define macro ARM_MATH_MVEI, If the silicon supports M-Profile Vector Extension.

   * - ARM_MATH_AUTOVECTORIZE
   *  Used in conjucture with ARM_MATH_MVEI to let the compiler auto vectorize for the functions that uses inline
   *  assembly. It does not affect functions that use C or intrinsics.
   * - ARM_MATH_BIG_ENDIAN:
   *
   * Define macro ARM_MATH_BIG_ENDIAN to build the library for big endian targets. This is supported only for the legacy
   * functions i.e, functions targetted at TensorFlow Lite do not support big endianness. By default library builds for
   * little endian targets.
   *
   * - ARM_NN_TRUNCATE:
   *
   * Define macro ARM_NN_TRUNCATE to use floor instead of round-to-the-nearest-int for the computation.
   *

/**
 * @defgroup NNConv Convolution Functions
 *
 * Collection of convolution, depthwise convolution functions and their variants.
 *
 * The convolution is implemented in 2 steps: im2col and GEMM
 *
 * im2col is a process of converting each patch of image data into
 * a column. After im2col, the convolution is computed as matrix-matrix
 * multiplication.
 *
 * To reduce the memory footprint, the im2col is performed partially.
 * Each iteration, only a few column (i.e., patches) are generated and
 * computed with GEMM kernels similar to CMSIS-DSP arm_mat_mult functions.
